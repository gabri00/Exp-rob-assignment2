## Preliminary operations

You'll need to install some additional ROS packages:

```bash
cd ~/<ros_workspace>/src
git clone https://github.com/CarmineD8/aruco_ros.git
git clone https://github.com/CarmineD8/SLAM_packages.git # Remember to switch to noetic branch
git clone https://github.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan.git
```

For *ROSPlan* follow the instruction in their [readme](https://github.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan/blob/master/README.md) to properly install the dependencies.

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/<ros_workspace>
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Build the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/<ros_workspace>
catkin_make
catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps my_rosplan_interface
```

## Run Gazebo simulation

Run the simulation:

```bash
roslaunch assignment_pkg simulation.launch
```

In another terminal, after launching the simulation, build and dispatch the plan:
```bash
cd ~/<ros_workspace>/src/Exp-rob-assignment2/
./rosplan_services.bash
```

To check the generated plan:
```bash
rostopic echo /rosplan_planner_interface/planner_output -p
```

## Description of the packages

The project works mainly through 3 packages:
1. *assignment_pkg*
2. *my_rosplan_interface*
3. *rosbot_ros* (and its sub-packages)

#### 1. assignment_pkg

#### 2. my_rosplan_interface

#### 3. rosbot_ros

This directory contains the set of packages of the [ROSbot](https://husarion.com/manuals/rosbot/).
It provides the basic functionalities of the robot, such as the *joint state controller* configuration and the *gmapping* launch files.
This directory mostly follows what has been done in the previous assignment ([Assignment 1](https://github.com/gabri00/Exp-rob-assignment1)).
